This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of the `trn' threaded
newsreader by Wayne Davison, Larry Wall and Stan Barber.

This package was put together by Jon Rabone <jkr@debian.org>, from
Wayne Davison's sources, obtained from 
unix.hensa.ac.uk:/mirrors/uunet/networking/news/readers/trn/trn-3.6.tar.gz.

The changes in this package are essentially the addition of
preconfigured `config.h' files and so forth and the addition of
support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding various
debian.* files; also the small patch to makedepend.SH below.

Trn 3.5 is Copyright 1993 Wayne Davison; Copyright 1991 Stan Barber;
Copyright 1985 Larry Wall.  Modifications for Debian GNU/Linux

[ I contacted Stan Barber, Wayne Davison and Larry Wall to ask for
clarification of this.  Stan Barber replied:
    This intent of the copyright is not to INCREASE the cost of a
    CD-ROM distribution just because *rn was added. Put another way, if
    you had a CD-ROM at $100 and added *rn and changed the cost to $110
    just because you added *rn, that would violate the intent of the
    copyright.
  and Wayne Davison agreed.  -- Ian Jackson, former trn maintainer ]

Date parsing code in parsedate.y originally written by Steven M.
Bellovin <smb@research.att.com> while at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Later tweaked by a couple of people on
Usenet.  Completely overhauled by Rich $alz <rsalz@osf.org> and Jim
Berets <jberets@bbn.com> in August, 1990.  Further revised (removed
obsolete constructs and cleaned up timezone names) in August, 1991, by
Rich.  Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com> helped in September, 1992.
This grammar has six shift/reduce conflicts.  This code is in the
public domain and has no copyright.


Regular expression parsing in search.c Copyright 1981, 1980 James
Gosling.  Modified by Tom London (1981); ripped to shreds and glued
back together to make a search package by Larry Wall (1984).


Unpacking of ship files in unship.c based on ship.c by Mark Adler
(1991).  This code is not copyrighted.  Modified by Wayne Davison.

I (the current Debian maintainer, Matthew Vernon <matthew@debian.org>)
believe that automatically building trn for other architectures is
fine under the set of licences above. If this ceases to be the case,
please contact nonfree@releases.debian.net
